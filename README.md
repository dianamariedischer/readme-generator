## Installation
A user can download the files through GitHub and once they've installed node and inquirer they can run it from their terminal.     

## Usage
Once a user is in the directory of the README generator, they can type "node index" which will initialize the user prompts. Once the user has completed the prompts, a README file will appear in the same folder, and the terminal will show the user a message that a file was created. If there were any errors the terminal will show the error.
